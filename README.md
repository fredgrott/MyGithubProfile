# Android Application Development Thesis

* My Code Auditing other Android Developers code proves that the resume does not correlate with the
  quality of android code produced.
* In those code audits I found that if one researches how to resolve each IDE code warning generated
  by the IDE, one can increase the quality of code and the stability of the android application by 25%.
* Developing Agile-style for GUI-intensified android applications requires preparation as I completed
  1200 commits in a 2.5 month period to formulate a set of UI libs that allows me to guarantee UI features
  look and feel across multiple Android OS versions.
* Flexible no-spec goal-posts project work-style with daily builds and weekly milestones for an extremely
  flexible agile style of being able to change project requirements as the start-up discovers the mobile
  application product.
* Remote Code Development means that I have more time to do Android Application end user analysis and
  use that insights to evolve the UI of the android application.

# Other Services

* Spec-And-ROI Analysis

  You as a start-up or enterprise may not have the resources to determine the core features of that first android
  application. I do spec-and-roi consultations on picky-ask basis. If that is your need than you should
  understand that due to the value of consultation that you might want that I have to ask for something
  in return. ASk about it, obviously those who answer my direct questions with direct answers get more
  attention though.

* Android Application Development Best Practices Consultation

  You may as an organization have the need for a short-term intensive course or courses in Android Application
  Development Best Practices. If so you should ask.

  I also do auditing of the android application development set of processes your developers are using
  and can offer paid advice on what changes need to be made to reach the short-term and long-range goals of
  a better system of android application development. Obviously, ask.

# How To Contact Me
