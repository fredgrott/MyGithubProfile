# Android Application Development Thesis

* My Code Auditing other Android Developers code proves that the resume does not correlate with the
  quality of android code produced.
* In those code audits I found that if one researches how to resolve each IDE code warning generated
  by the IDE, one can increase the quality of code and the stability of the android application by 25%.
* Developing Agile-style for GUI-intensified android applications requires preparation as I completed
  1200 commits in a 2.5 month period to formulate a set of UI libs that allows me to guarantee UI features
  look and feel across multiple Android OS versions.
* Flexible no-spec goal-posts project work-style with daily builds and weekly milestones for an extremely
  flexible agile style of being able to change project requirements as the start-up discovers the mobile
  application product.
* Remote Code Development means that I have more time to do Android Application end user analysis and
  use that insights to evolve the UI of the android application.

# How To Contact Me

* No inside or outside recruiters
* Must be a start-up co-founder, either CEO or CTO
* Must allow remote coding, if no and want me to relocate than that requires you to meet at my location
  over a paid meal.
* If local to Chicago, must agree to meet over a paid meal at my location

If you meet those conditions than by all means
