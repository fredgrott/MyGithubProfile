MyGithubProfile
===============

I am a software engineer and developer that happens to be a computer language polyglot and an android
java application developer. So as to act as a guide to those start-up co-founders who are seeking an
android developer I have created this git repo and readme to point out some of my git repos that should
be closely examined by your engineering staff that hires android developers such as your CTO, etc.

I am also have a top 17% stactoverflow rating for using my java and android skills and experience in
answering other developers questions about android development using java.

The Gradle Build System in the Android Context
----------------------------------------------

[GWSDroidGradle](http://github.com/shareme/GWSDroidGradle)

This is my android specific gradle set-up that I keep current with the gradle plugins and debug tool
set up that I use to develop android applications. In the readme you will find a detailed implementation
description with the tools I use.

Test Libraries of Mine Used
---------------------------

I have created some test and debug libraries that I use for testing. Implementation description blocks in
each git repo describe the implementation involved.



Common App Libraries
--------------------

I have created some common app libraries as it reduces the boilerplate I have to copy for each android
application I create. Such things as a custom type loader library, material colors, caches, etc. Implementation
description block in each git repo describes the implementation involved.

[GWSAndroidUUID](http://github.com/shareme/GWSAndroidUUID)

Creates a factory class to load a shared-prefs stored UUID or create a new one in somewhat secure fashion in
protecting the androidID value. An UUID finds its use in we need to track application errors and crash
statistics by user and user usage by UUID value.



UI Features Back-ported Android Libraries
-----------------------------------------

I created some UI Feature back-ported android libraries that corrected compatibility issues and made
the libraries more reliable for developers to use including myself. Most them contain both a descriptive
implementation description in the readme and a demo signed apk app file in the demo folder to try out.

If the newest feature is not in these libraries it probably cannot be back-ported.
