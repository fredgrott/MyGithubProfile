You are either a CEO co-founder or a CTO co-founder of a start-up between $250,000 and $5 Million
in seed capital looking to build your very first android edition of your mobile application or to polish up the android prototype application and I DO NOT LIVE WHERE YOU LIVE. And I must make a side comment right now:

     IF I commute 2 to 3 hours to work daily when do I have time
     to talk to customers of the android application? And there
     is the rub as the typical LinkedIN start-up lead asks and
     demands that I drive 2 to 3 hours to work because they
     cannot find an android developer in their location.


     WE DO NOT WANT TO BE FORCED to limit my interactions with
     customers of the android application I develop due to the
     start-up forcing me into some long-drive commute. AND IF YOU
     ARE A SMART CUSTOMER AND PRODUCT START-UP, you do not want
     me to either. Shocking, right? An android developer that
     wants the free-ness to talk to customers of the android
     application.


While many android developers are making pretty UIs its the quality of the underlying code that
translates into that long-tail of monthly high MAUs. That comes about through quality of android
code and instrumented testing of that UI code!

With everyone using an android device people get trained to want and to expect that high-quality
stable user-interface that most Google applications exhibit. And rememebr most things in design
like The-Grid-System, The-Color-Wheel, etc are not designed by designers but designed by
science-people in order to present science ot non-science people. Which means basically that our
highly valued android application with its high stability starts on the science side of things
not the design side of visual arts.

And creating an android application in a start-up has to accomplish several things at once. One,
one has to create small steps in which we can see parts of the android application working and
stable enough that non-developers can try the prototype of the application...ie the small batch
size as evidenced by daily builds and weekly milestones. Yet the underlying infrastructure of the
application which is being built concurrently along with the user-interface has to adapt to changes
both in the user-interface and the mobile application product itself.

The way to accomplish that is to have a measuring of code quality in place and an infrastructure of
java best practices and libraries set-up in such a way that encourages a HIGH-DEGREE of FEED-BACK FROM NON-DEVELOPERS.
So let me tell you about the first part in what I found in examining other android developer's code.


Basically, I completed a code audit on android code to see how prevalent bad code is and ended up
cleaning up 50 android libraries to use them. Everything from improperly implementing java generics,
not porting a feature back to previous android OS versions properly, completing tasks on the
wrong thread, not separating android stuff from the rest of code such as domain layers repository layers
use cases and entities, etc.

I found these things based on my previous experience in enterprise java where we build big stable things
and my previous experience in mobile java including javaME and javaTV.

And I must point out to you that recruiters and temp agencies do not code audit the android dev candidates.
I do code audit candidates if I am asked to find an android developer as I have found in my experience
it is the one sure way to get the android code quality needed at 95% chance that it is correct from
the developer chosen.


The very fact that I went to the trouble of code cleaning up 50 android libraries of UI back-ported
features should tell you these things:

0. The difference between just an android application and a polished android application is all that
   boilerplate code that makes it easier to implement the components of the android application and
   the UI.  Due to android applications targeting about TEN different OS versions the UI back-ported
   libs used in android application can typically number from 5 all the way to 25. And the other
   accessory libraries ten to number from 5 all the way to 50. So those libraries have to have
   proper logging, code quality, etc for me to use them and I have to use them from they very
   beginning of building a new android application. For your android application for the start-up
   that means I can get to the UI featured milestones faster and thus you can use parts of the
   application as I build it.

1. I can daily build code, I can weekly build milestones that work, and I can ship product.

2. Remote work always has a trust issue along with the trust of having someone else make 1000 decisions
   in coding an android application, yes there is  1000 decisions involved.  You can see that in a
   2 to 3 month period that I completed 1150 commits. Or to put another way that is 10 commits per day.
   If you read Google engineering blogs they tend to talk about having 2 to 5 code commits per week.

3. You know that when things need done, that I rise up and get those things done including the research
   on new stuff to see what best practices need to be followed, etc etc..that is probably the biggest
   requirement in a developer that an early stage start-up has or would like to find in a developer.

Some other proof of my android application software development expertise is of course these things:

1. Top 16% at stack-overflow in answering other developer questions which is the same high rate as
   the developers at Group, Shiftgig, spotHero, etc:

[StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/237740/fred-grott)



Probably someone who measures their code against the big names like Groupon, Shiftgig, SpotHero, etc
is probably the android developer you might want for your start-up.

2. I also get asked about android, technology, and startups at quora:

Quora tends to be non-tech in the level of explanation and thus its a strong correlation that I like
explaining things in straight English or the like-I-am-5 meme that is so prevalent on reddit.

3. My medium articles about android application development are highly read:

The other aspect is to get that work-in-progress android application to non-developers to use as
far as using that prototype. That is where my system of following best practices to in a reliable fashion
get daily builds and weekly milestones which is in fact a working android application. In other words,
even though I do use developer feed-back in my process to increase code quality I am using higher
amounts of NON-DEVELOPER FEED-BACK to make sure we can all see where the product direction should
go in that we see huge increases in use of a certain feature, etc or we see huge increases in
user inquiries of requesting a certain new feature, etc.

You as the start-up have a unique resource to use in-place of having a lot of money to set up a
user usability lab. That resource is the potential customers who are already interested in your
start-up's product and or service. Thus, we set up the android application development process to
integrate and use that resource by building a weekly milestone of the android application that
happens to be usable at some level or in other words a progressing-prototype where every few weeks
one can try out different versions of that prototype.

I already as an android developer break down a big android application development cycle into
small things so that I can show the start-up stakeholders development progress. Why not re-use
that to put prototypes in the start-up's potential customers hands to get that valuable gold-like
customer-feed-back? The start-up product is not just the finished android application and the
services it hooks up to but the whole process of discovering what the customer might want in an
android application. That of course is one of the things Eric Ries refers to in The Lean Start-up.

Every android application consumer wants to feel important and by getting them to feel important
they than develop a trust of your start-up's product and services. Asking for their feed-back early
on a prototype and often thus serves two missions developing their trust of the product and giving
the start-up the feed-back needed to get to the full marketable product.

Is that not what it is all about? Customers and Product?


At the end of this you will find some links detailing the libraries that I code cleaned up along
with the development processes I use. But at this time I would like to detail the directions for contacting me.

So you want to contact me but I have to manage my time to devote it to the leads that matter.
So you have to be a start-up between $250,000 and $5 million in seed capital and USA based and
allow someone to remotely develop the android application and of course either the CEO co-founder
or the CTO co-founder to contact me.

What if you are not? As long as you are not an inside or outside recruiter and understand that
a freelance android development contract is double the amount of an employed developer's hourly pay
and understand that it I will be coding remotely than you can contact me. But just like the
start-up the budget for the android application development costs will have to be there.




So you should contact me by email if you meet the above definition and my email is:


fred DOT grott AT gmail DOT com



Okay, this is the part where I give some links to details about my development processes and
details of the libraries I have to do all the new UI features on older versions of android, as
always if you do not understand something ask me for further details. Whether you choose to use
my services and my android application software development expertise or not my hope is that your
brand new android application allows your start-up to get several steps closer to that platform
vision that you have and are building.
