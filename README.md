I cause trouble, I do not follow your rules, and I innovate and lead. Its no longer
the dawn of the mobile age and every mobile application intensively competes for
some type of mobile device attention.

We are all sneezers about our own life and the tools that allow us to live that
novel that is our life. A radical concept, if you [LAUNCH THEIR LIVES](./readme_details/launch) with your mobile application, than you mobile application users become that conversation advertising your
mobile application. Is that not radical, create their product instead of yours and have the mobile application users become part of the marketing conversation about that
mobile application because its launching that novel that is their life?

# My Android Java Application Development Thesis

* Code Quality Does Not Correlate With Resume, recently I did a code audit of some
  User-Interface Android Libraries and found that the code quality of those libraries
  did not match the quality of the resume of the developer. This is why recruiters are so damn
  infective in finding Senior Android Developers. This is why you should be seeking the hackers
  who innovate and lead as a consultant and why using a PSF(Tom Peters term) to fulfill your
  start-up's Android Java Application Development needs.

* [Android vs iOS](./readme_details/android), Android is different with multiple form factors and
  device types and I can develop Android Application Prototypes faster than a iOS developer
  can develop an iOS prototype which is significantly important for start-ups.

* [Fast Agile Android Java Application Development](./readme_details/agile), By intelligently choosing
  among the many Agile Development Tools in my software engineering tool-box I can determine a
  development solution that reaches the goals of fast prototyping an Android Java Application that
  looks and feels polished to the mobile application user.

* [Remote Code Development-ReWork](./readme_details/rework), creative or creating is somewhat
  a different activity in that one needs continuous blocks of time to be productive and thus I complete
  my software engineering and code development remotely.

* [My WorkStyle-WorkShop](./readme_details/workshop), hence the name GrottWorkShop as when you enter any
  craft-person's workshop you notice that its flexible in layout fo tools and equipment to be appropriated
  for the goals of the project-at-hand.


# Services

[My Services](./readme_details/services) include Spec and ROI Report Analysis, Android Developer Training,
Freelance Android Application Development, Code Auditing and Code QA consulting, etc. See the link for details.


# How I Work

My work-style is the flexible [work-shop work-style](./readme_details/workshop) that for the benefits of
start-ups and their co-founders includes no-spec bids, [Android Agile Application Development](./readme_details/agile) including daily testing and builds,
weekly billing, and [remote code development-rework](./readme_details/rework).

# How To Contact Me

Generally in [contacting me(Fred Grott-GWS)](./readme_details/contact) don't be an asshole and think because you are an inside or
outside recruiter that you have a right to my time as i have ano-recruiters rule that I follow.
Those that generally are best fit are when you might be a co-founder of the start-up in the form of a
CEO or CTO.

Obviously, I do [remote code development-rework](./readme_details/rework) and your expectations
should match up with that requirement.
