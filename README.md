I am one of the unofficial Google Developer Experts and my focus happens to be
Android Application Software Engineering from the developer work-flow including the tools use to
build the app not limited to the gradle scripts, plugins, IDE plugins all the way to new
software engineering techniques and libraries. I have watched start-up mistakes crash and burn
from the vantage-point of having my hands tied behind my back and thus prefer a start-up where
by advice and counsel is actually respected and acted upon as it makes for a successful adventure.

I do not play telephone games of having someone who does not know try to translate what the
co-founder and CTO want as it is more effective to just talk to the CTO and co-founder in the
first place. Besides since I am evaluating the start-up to see if the can get an attention and
an audience I actually need to talk to the co-founders and CTO to be able to make that determination.

My first question to you will be are you funded and I prefer to verify that before we continue. My
second question will concern ROI in the form of is there a business model of who the start-up will make money.
My third question will be how many applicants as I do not enter lottery games and thus if the
answer is above 10 than I will decline to proceed.

Obviously, there are links below that can be used to verify my Android Application Software Expertise.
Its in your best interest to make that attempt and to ask me questions rather than depend on a
recruiter to fuck it up as you always are paying through-the-nose to train and educate the recruiter
and most often its at the very high premium price, something start-ups have no business doing in the
first place.

Warning, I have found that innovations come from having enough trust in my expertise to let me break
whatever guideline or rule that is the obstacle to discover something new and worthwhile. I prefer
start-up environments that have the freedom to allow me to do that.

# My Android Java Application Development Thesis

* Code Quality Does Not Correlate With Resume, recently I did a code audit of some
  User-Interface Android Libraries and found that the code quality of those libraries
  did not match the quality of the resume of the developer. This is why recruiters are so damn
  infective in finding Senior Android Developers. This is why you should be seeking the hackers
  who innovate and lead as a consultant and why using a PSF(Tom Peters term) to fulfill your
  start-up's Android Java Application Development needs.

* [Android vs iOS](./readme_details/android), Android is different with multiple form factors and
  device types and I can develop Android Application Prototypes faster than a iOS developer
  can develop an iOS prototype which is significantly important for start-ups.

* [Fast Agile Android Java Application Development](./readme_details/agile), By intelligently choosing
  among the many Agile Development Tools in my software engineering tool-box I can determine a
  development solution that reaches the goals of fast prototyping an Android Java Application that
  looks and feels polished to the mobile application user.

* [Remote Code Development-ReWork](./readme_details/rework), creative or creating is somewhat
  a different activity in that one needs continuous blocks of time to be productive and thus I complete
  my software engineering and code development remotely.

* [My WorkStyle-WorkShop](./readme_details/workshop), hence the name GrottWorkShop as when you enter any
  craft-person's workshop you notice that its flexible in layout fo tools and equipment to be appropriated
  for the goals of the project-at-hand.


# Services

[My Services](./readme_details/services) include Spec and ROI Report Analysis, Android Developer Training,
Freelance Android Application Development, Code Auditing and Code QA consulting, etc. See the link for details.


# How I Work

My work-style is the flexible [work-shop work-style](./readme_details/workshop) that for the benefits of
start-ups and their co-founders includes no-spec bids, [Android Agile Application Development](./readme_details/agile) including daily testing and builds,
weekly billing, and [remote code development-rework](./readme_details/rework).

# How To Contact Me

Generally in [contacting me(Fred Grott-GWS)](./readme_details/contact) don't be an asshole and think because you are an inside or
outside recruiter that you have a right to my time as i have ano-recruiters rule that I follow.
Those that generally are best fit are when you might be a co-founder of the start-up in the form of a
CEO or CTO.

Obviously, I do [remote code development-rework](./readme_details/rework) and your expectations
should match up with that requirement.
