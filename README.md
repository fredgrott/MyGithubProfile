Everyone seems to like Penn and Teller magic shows. They put on a show doing things
that seem impossible and seem effort-less. But just like the magic they put on,
creating an android java application that wows its device owner is somewhat making the
impossible happen without effort.

Penn and Teller practice each magic trick at least 2 to 3 years before its performed in
front of an audience(its to kill all those red-Shirt interns, every see red shirt interns on a
Penn and Teller show? Now you know what happen to them.). Just like death defying magic, mobile
GUI creating takes preparation work where one builds up some GUI parts that one can re-combine
into something magical.

By making those re-usable GUI components stable and well behaved AND USING AGILE SOFTWARE
ENGINEERING BEST PRACTICES, I move the Android Application user retention curve upward. The best
practices allow me due to my intensive preparation to move at agile speed in developing your
Android Application prototype. This GrottWorkShop Agile System was developed based on
actual experience in working for other start-ups and working my own start-up.


# Android Application Development Thesis

* My Code Auditing other Android Developers code proves that the resume does not correlate
  with the quality of android code produced.
* In those code audits I found that if one researches how to resolve each IDE code warning
  generated by the IDE, one can increase the quality of code and the stability of the android
  application by 25%.
* Developing Agile-style for GUI-intensified android applications requires preparation
  as I  completed 1200 commits in a 2.5 month period to formulate a set of UI libs that
  allows me to guarantee UI features look and feel across multiple Android OS versions.
* Flexible no-spec goal-posts project work-style with daily builds and weekly milestones
  for an extremely flexible agile style of being able to change project requirements as the
  start-up discovers the mobile application product.
* Remote Code Development means that I have more time to do Android Application end user
  analysis and use that insights to evolve the UI of the android application.

# Services

* Freelancing Android Java Application Development

  I consult and develop android applications under 1099 for select start-ups and firms.
  Freelance consulting and development work is through my billing and contract terms.

* Fast Agile Android Application Prototype Development

  If you are a start-up and need something market validated and have the seed capital than this service
  may be of interest to you.

* Spec-And-ROI Analysis

  You as a start-up or enterprise may not have the resources to determine the core features of that
  first android application. I do spec-and-roi consultations on picky-ask basis. If that is your
  need than you should understand that due to the value of consultation that you might want that
  I have to ask for something in return. Ask about it, obviously those who answer my
  direct questions with direct answers get more attention though.

* Android Application Development Best Practices Consultation

  You may as an organization have the need for a short-term intensive course or courses in
  Android Application Development Best Practices. If so you should ask.

  I also do auditing of the android application development set of processes your developers are
  using and can offer paid advice on what changes need to be made to reach the short-term and long-range
  goals of a better system of android application development. Obviously, ask.

* NOTE: If you are a start-up and not at the stage of seed capital but you still need some advice or
  consultation than I am open to you in-advance ordering $250 worth of food I specify through the
  Taste-of-Chicago website I specify delivered to my location and then when that arrives I than do a
  consultation with you about your start-up and mobile application project.

# How I Work

* Client Feed-back

  Daily work summary reports and weekly work summary reports are issued on the respective time periods
  to the client.

  A SLACK-CHANNEL is set-up per project so that all the stake-holders on the client side can ask questions
  on a daily basis about the project and project progress.

  I maintain a GOOGLE-VOICE NUMBER that clients get access to also ask questions about project progress.

  Depending upon a project set of requirements I either due daily invoicing or weekly invoicing. Included
  in that invoicing is a work project progress summary and details.

  Although, I store the project code both locally and in-the-cloud; I still mail out weekly a DVD that contains
  a full archived zipped file of the Android Application source code. I also make back-up copies that
  stored in secure location.

* Work Style

  As I have stated in several places, I work on a remote basis as than I can control the environment in
  which I develop android application code. At times that might mean that I code awhile wrapping
  day into night. At other times I might code only during daylight.

  This effective works as I make daily and weekly progress reports and always answer the questions posed
  on my Google-Voice mail, the project established SLACK-CHANNEL and via email.

* Project Billing

  I always estimate development time and project costs and bill on a weekly basis with the first week
  in ADVANCE.

  There is no heavy COLLECTIONS-CLAUSE as its very simple, if the project check fails to show up the week
  after work is completed than contract terminates as that respects both parties short-term and
  long-term goals.
