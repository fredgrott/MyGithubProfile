A 5 years experience android developer resume has no direct correlation to quality android code or a 
quality android application which I just confirmed by a massive code audit of 50 libraries and several 
android applications. Yes you can hold out for that one 5 year experience android developer and can not 
only be dissatisfied in the quality of android code and the quality of the android application and to 
top things off that developer will have issues with having a start-up almost no-structure in that they are not 
accustom to managing their own development process or coming up with new development processes.

Or you can engage the mind that you have and get a real android developer that is not hung up on the words 
on a resume but looks at stuff that needs doing and determines how to get it accomplished.  In fact you 
can see on my github profile:

[github profile](https://github.com/shareme)

a strong correlation of shipping product and doing daily builds and weekly milestones. There is also 
a strong correlation to my android application software development expertise claim in the form of 
answering other android developer's questions at stackoverflow:


[StackOverflow Profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/237740/fred-grott)

I have the same high 17% top ranking as android developers at ShiftGig, Groupon, SpotHero, etc.

MyGithubProfile
===============

I am a software engineer and developer that happens to be a computer language polyglot and an android
java application developer. So as to act as a guide to those start-up co-founders who are seeking an
android developer I have created this git repo and readme to point out some of my git repos that should
be closely examined by your engineering staff that hires android developers such as your CTO, etc.

I am also have a top 17% StackOverflow rating:

[StackOverflow Profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/237740/fred-grott)

for using my java and android skills and experience in
answering other developers questions about android development using java.
The SO 17% top rating for android developer questions is what most senior android developers have
if they are a member of StackOverflow. And just like other senior android developers I have developed
libraries, tools, and processes that build on top of all the java, GUI, and android best practices to
ensure quality java code and quality android applications developed.

Why portfolio this way?

The biggest part of getting the android UX of an application and the android application design right
is the big thing under the surface like an iceberg such as the actual java skills and knowledge and the
android skills and knowledge and that very important set of manual habits and java development best
practices.

A few portfolio apps only teases you without providing a concrete way to establish that the android developer
or android application engineer in fact follows those practices. Now if someone has a system to ensure that
why not show off that system? Than you would emphatically know, right?


Your Pain Points
-----------------

Keep in mind that the best fit is if you are a Chicago start-up willing to allow a remote-telecommute
or providing resources to reduce a commute and building the android edition of yor mobile application for
the very first time. And you should be willing to set-aside the HR-hiring process as its completely broken and I refuse to
go through such a broken process as its somewhat akin to banging one's head against a brick wall until
bleeding(not very fun).

1. You want to find a quality android developer with some strong java skills and who has a polished
   android app development work-flow.

   I have over 1000 commits during a 2 month-period just to establish a polished android development
   work-flow including the expert gradle build scripts, library code covering debug helper classes to
   and UI back-ported features.

2. Specific uses case where you would need an expert android developer that has code-audited libraries that
   they rely upon and developed some developer tools to ease development improve the development work-flow
   including debugging an in-progress-UI design range from a mobile development development service firm to
   an actual start-up building their very first android application.


3. Assuming that you are not Google or Apple, which both TRAIN their middle managers in how to interview and
   analyze interviews of both developers and designers, you are probably not focusing on training yourself
   in how to interview a developer and or designer and you are not focusing on the heavy data analysis to remove
   all the noise from the interview input you are receiving. It is somewhat important to have a meal-meeting
   to get that insight and guide in how to do exactly that from an android developer expert. My example, is that since
   the previous start-ups I have worked for have made all the mobile mistakes by not listening to me
   I can inform yo on what to avoid and inform you both on the results of not avoiding such a blind-spot and
   the exact good things that result on avoiding such blind-spots.

   The ROI you have in your mind is predicated by the future mobile dev efforts avoiding the blind-spots
   both start-ups and firms new to mobile and android make.

4. My ROI proposition to you is that I have some experience that has helped me create new tools and processes
   that allow me to in an agile way develop an android application in a fast manner and I have experience in
   experiencing all the blind-spots a start-up or firm new to mobile and android can make and so I can assist
   you and your firm in avoiding such blind-spots.

   Because that ROI is more valuable than the borken HR-hiring process that you mightt have thought about using
   I only do meal-meetings at my local eating establishments.

   [See my Medium article. Why I don't do coffee](https://medium.com/@fredgrott/chicago-start-ups-i-don-t-do-coffee-d3f1fccb1c7a)

   While some might say avoid at first building for more than one mobile platform, there is actually some useful
   data patterns that can giver you some goal-posts on your decision to build for more than one mobile platform or not
   decision rather than some brief-sentence and thus really steer towards an effective right decision by
   removing the noise from the data, etc.

   And that is just one of the high-impact ROI items as there is also the developer decisions that I have
   to make in developing an android application concerning OS version fragmentation, etc that impact the
   design palette that I may have to work with in implementing an android user-interface application design.
   Certain choices give me a more fuller palette as far as the UI design I can come up with and others are more
   limiting in design.

   It is your JOB as start-up CO-FOUNDER to get that valuable information and that is really what the
   recruiting expert mobile developers to interview should be about. You need that expert advice  in order to
   understand hwo to transform your mobile visions into concrete ROI. Do not accept an outsider or someone
   else to do that important information gathering job for you.

   You as a co-founder need to ask this question of your staff, how is it that I can in  2 hours complete
   a code audit of potential android developers code and determine which is the best android developer
   and yet you are still using a broken process that wil in months not produce effective results of picking an
   android developer? That is about like expecting to get rich betting on the lottery.

   Do you not deserve to use a better way?

The GrottWorkSpace System
=========================

The GrottWorkSpace system is collection of manual java and android best practices, tools, and libraries
that together form a set of processes that ensure that a quality mobile android java application is
produced that is easy to test and easy to maintain and update. The following detailed libraries, tools,
and practices compose of that system.

The reasons for code auditing and cleaning up 3rd-party back-ported android UI libraries
range from using Engineering best practices to being able to rely upon other libraries to
having  a need for those libraries to be cleaned up so I can convert them to RxJava use as one cannot use
libraries that refer to views, fragments , activities and widgets but have to use Rxjava
style things that have wrapped certain things for full RxJava usage.

Real professional mobile application developers code audit the potential libraries they want to use and
yes even when the library is from a trusted source like Google. Its one of the tools we have in determining
an excellent android developer from a lack-luster average android developer.







The Gradle Build System in the Android Context
----------------------------------------------

Without a dependable build you cannot as an android application engineer predict milestone builds or
steps in the development process.

GWSJinn
--------------
[GWSJinn](https://github.com/shareme/GWSJinn)

This is my android specific gradle set-up that I keep current with the gradle plugins and debug tool
set up that I use to develop android applications. In the readme you will find a detailed implementation
description with the tools I use.



Test Libraries of Mine Used
---------------------------

I have created some test and debug libraries that I use for testing. Implementation description blocks in
each git repo describe the implementation involved.




GWSWakeUp
---------

[GWSWakeUp](https://github.com/shareme/GWSWakeUp)

This library allows or enables the device to wake up as the app is pushed to the device or emulator
for testing.

GWSDroidViewServer
------------------

[GWSDroidViewServer](https://github.com/shareme/GWSDroidViewServer)

GWSDroidViewServer is a library to enable a debug build of an android application to hook into the
Hierarchy View tool of the android sdk so that we can examine the view tree structure of the application.

GWSDroidInsUtil
---------------

[GWSDroidInsUtil](https://github.com/shareme/GWSDroidInsUtil)

The GWSDroidInsUtil library contains some classes that set up a testing rule to run a test multiple times
to dela with a flaky test and a class to assist in disabling system animations during test and to re-enable
system animations once testing is completed.




Common App Libraries
--------------------

I have created some common app libraries as it reduces the boilerplate I have to copy for each android
application I create. Such things as a custom type loader library, material colors, caches, etc. Implementation
description block in each git repo describes the implementation involved.

GWSAndroidUUID
--------------
[GWSAndroidUUID](https://github.com/shareme/GWSAndroidUUID)

Creates a factory class to load a shared-prefs stored UUID or create a new one in somewhat secure fashion in
protecting the androidID value. An UUID finds its use in we need to track application errors and crash
statistics by user and user usage by UUID value.

GWSCache
--------

[GWSCache](https://github.com/shareme/GWSCache)

GWSCache is a library to enable to setting of an application wide cache in the android application that
happens to be two-level, in memory and in disk-file.

GWSColors
---------

[GWSColours](https://github.com/shareme/GWSColours)

The android support libs v7 privatize resource color names so we as developers are not suppose to use them
or rely upon them. Thus instead I extended the Colours Android library to allow the setting of all the
material colours and as a bonus one gets to use the helper methods of the Colours Android library for free.

GWSCacheFragment
----------------

[GWSCacheFragment](https://github.com/shareme/GWSCacheFragment)

When a UI component called View-Pager is used in the android application to switch between multiple pages
we usually have to cache those pages and this library enables me to accomplish that goal.

GWSEasing
---------

[GWSEasing](https://github.com/shareme/GWSEasing)

Easing animation functions were not fully supplied until api 18 level and thus I use this library in api
levels lower than 18 to supply easing animation functions for UI element animations.

GWSIndiaInk
------------

[GWSIndiaInk](https://github.com/shareme/GWSIndiaInk)

GWSUIndiaInk is the library I created to enable me to load custom fonts for an android application.

GWSSpannable
------------

[GWSSpannable](https://github.com/shareme/GWSSpannable)

Its easier to do spannable than always extend text view and so I created this library to use the collection
spannables that I have created and collected.

GWSSytemUI
----------

[GWSSystemUI](https://github.com/shareme/GWSSystemUI)

A system UI element helper set of classes.

GWSOttoUtils
------------

[GWSOttoUtils](https://github.com/shareme/GWSOttoUtils)

I use the Otto even bus system to allow me to de-couple android application components and these helper
classes he me set up a proper event bus.

GWSEula
--------

[GWSEula](https://github.com/shareme/GWSEula)

In the USA and EU the legal environment requires all software applications to have an Eula so that the
application development company is protected, hence this library.

GWSLicenseThis
--------------

[GWSLicenseThis]

Library to allow displaying the application license to the user on first start of the application.

GWSVMUtils
----------

[GWSVMUtils]

Simplified ViewModel and State Machine classes to make it easier to use a ModelViewViewModel solution in
application implementations.

GWSDroidUtil
------------

[GWSDroidUtil](https://github.com/shareme/GWSDroidUtil)

Utility classes that do not fit any other category that get used to reduce boilerplate classes and methods in
android application.

GWSStateMachine
---------------

[GWSStateMachine]

Multi-purpose state machine classes in the form of a sueful library.



UI Features Back-ported Android Libraries
-----------------------------------------

With each major Google UX Design Change(the happen every 18 to 36 months) within the Android Mobile OS and
Framework platform there emerges a combination of UX work-around elements that allows 3rd-party android
application developers to get a consistent look and feel across multiple Android OS versions that reaches
about 95% of the feature-set of the current newest Android OS version. But, most of the 3rd-party back-ported
libraries are never in a full polished state that you can fully rely upon them. Whereas if one looks at
the full 'forest' of back-ported libraries and corrects them, and curates them than we get a component of
a system whereas we always know we can achieve the consisten UX look and feel.



I created some UI Feature back-ported android libraries that corrected compatibility issues and made
the libraries more reliable for developers to use including myself. Most them contain both a descriptive
implementation description in the readme and a demo signed apk app file in the demo folder to try out.

If the newest feature is not in these libraries it probably cannot be back-ported.


GWSArcAnimations

I like most android advance application developers contribute to the Android AOSP project and these
following 3rd-party libraries:

[RxLifecycle](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle)

[Assertj for Android](https://github.com/square/assertj-android)

[LogLifecycle](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/loglifecycle)

[Getting things Done-Tiddlywiki](https://github.com/roma0104/gsd5)


Best Practices Followed
------------------------

1. Keeping things on the proper thread, inflate and resource stuff is always on the UI thread while
   some longer running shared prefs editing we try to have on a non ui thread.

2. Make sure that all the stuff that could be transformed to using generics is in fact done and if
   not than mark it with an supper warnings unchecked to let other devs know that this process was completed.

3. Mark all depreciated classes and methods as supper warnings depreciated as in apps you have to
   do this anyway as the proguard will not obfuscate without it completed.

4. Using patterns and compound patterns where appropriate to structure the library or application in
   a way makes it more modular and efficient.

5. Only have logs showing in debug and not production builds as the only thing that should in
   application logs production wise is the crash stuff and that should be a rarity not something
   that happens often.

6. Using different methods and tools to de-couple classes, modules, etc so that we can more
   effectively test using instrumented testing and functional testing.

7. Reading Android AOSP project sources as the Google Engineers put helpful comments and from time
   to time find stuff that should be back proted to use on older versions of the android OS as well
   new ways to re-use some classes and methods.

8. Making sure to have things executed on the proper step within the Application, Activity, Fragment,
   and View life-cycles.

9. Applying color theory, typography and graphics design in an design and brand marketing appropriate
   manner in the android UX design context and Google Material design context.

10. Being aware of what the limitations to the tools and libraries used in my android development
    stack as it pertains to solving the problems-at-hand in developing a specific android application.


Contacting Me
-------------

Rules for contacting me:

1. Not a recruiter but a start-up founder or co-founder

2. If start-up than its seed capital 'run-way' is fully funded at $1 Million or more with the best
   fit being that you are as a start-up building your very first android edition of your application.

3. If a Chicago start-up than willing to travel to my NorthWest Indiana location and discuss over a
   paid subway meal and discuss a relocation.

4. If not a Chicago start-up than willing to allow me to do remote(as I prefer not to devote 50%
   of my net income towards extremely high apartment rents and leasing) and enter a lengthy and informative
   discussion about your android application development needs.

5. It has to be android java application development not anything touching C/C++ or
   embedded development. If you really want embedded and cannot find any one than its  somewhat 200%
   of the android java application market price at 1099 with a cash advance.

6. I only find qualified android developers for recruitment purposes on paid-commission re-using tools
   and processes from my GrottWorkSpace system and the pricing starts at $95,000 per developer needed.
   Please do not ask for freebies.

7. Obviously, do not pull the recruiter crap and seek my Google-Voice-Number to call me daily to
   inquire about recruiting me as my quiet coding time is somewhat important to me.

If you can follow those rules than you can email me at:

fred DOT grott AT gmail DOT com
