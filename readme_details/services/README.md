My Services- Fred Grott(GrottWorkShop)
======================================

My list of services is:

* Freelancing Android Java Application Development

  I consult and develop android applications under 1099 for select start-ups
  and firms. Freelance consulting and development work is through my billing
  and contract terms.

* Fast Agile Android Application Prototype Development

  If you are a start-up and need something market validated and have the seed
  capital than this service may be of interest to you.

* Spec-And-ROI Analysis

  You as a start-up or enterprise may not have the resources to determine the
  core features of that first android application. I do spec-and-roi consultations
  on picky-ask basis. If that is your need than you should understand that due
  to the value of consultation that you might want that I have to ask for
  something in return. Ask about it, obviously those who answer my direct
  questions with direct answers get more attention though.

* Android Application Development Best Practices Consultation, Training

  You may as an organization have the need for a short-term intensive course
  or courses in Android Application Development Best Practices. If so you
  should ask.

* Code Auditing and Code QA

  I also do auditing of the android application development set of processes
  your developers are using and can offer paid advice on what changes
  need to be made to reach the short-term and long-range
  goals of a better system of android application development.
  Obviously, ask.

* Project Estimations

  You, the start-up co-founder, may need to ask for advice on what an android application development costs
  might be for your particular concept. Its on ask basis and I do not choose to do every project estimation.
  The ones that get chosen to receive a project estimation generally have made the effort to in-advance send
  me $250 worth of frozen-food from the ChicagoTaste website.

In Tom Peters terms its about me servicing your start-up by Launching your Android Application User's lives.
