LAUNCH THEIR LIVES
==================

Mobile Applications are very different from Web Applications. Web Applications
and Google Searches are about the INTENT to do SOMETHING.

Mobile Applications are more EMOTIONAL and VISCERAL in that LAUNCHING and RETELLING someone's LIFE in terms of THEIR HOPES, DREAMS, and ASPIRATIONS and steps and
tools to obtain those things is what the MOBILE APPLICATION is all about.
YOU WANT THEM to feel that the MOBILE APPLICATION they just downloaded and
or bought gives them some steps and tools towards REALIZING THEIR DREAMS, HOPES, ABITIIONS, and ASPIRATIONS. If you do that in your Android Application than
you will have those mobile application users for LIFE as far as them using your application on a monthly basis.

The other IMPORTANT aspect of LAUNCHING THEIR LIFE is that by transforming
data to a new use or service one can provide resources in the form of tasks
and steps that TRANSFORMS ones LIFE in doing a set of tasks of an activity.

But you need a structure of code that combines with a visual stunning GUI
using HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY and HUMAN BIOLOGY that provides a framework that in
little steps LAUNCHES THEIR LIVES in steps towards REALIZING THEIR DREAMS,
HOPES, and AMBITIONS.

By LAUNCHING THEIR LIFE you can LAUNCH your start-up. By LAUNCHING THEIR LIFE
you can LAUNCH that increase in productivity that saves your enterprise money.
WILL YOU NOT TAKE THAT STEP TO LAUNCH THEIR LIVES?
