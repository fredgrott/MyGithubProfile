My WorkStyle-WorkShop
======================

My work-style matches the flexibility found in workshops, hence the name GrottWorkShop:

* No spec bids and contracts, specifications are usually used with IBM-style waterfall slow-as-cement
  software engineering development work-styles and thus I do not use them. Instead I use a strategy of
  delineating the goal-posts that mark the goals of the project and creative interviewing of stakeholders
  on a weekly and daily basis adjusting project items to match the changes.

* As stated in [Fast Agile Android Application Development](../readme_details/agile) I build and test projects on a daily
  and weekly basis. Part of that Agile Process is also that I write detailed project progress reports
  that also become part of the weekly billing invoices sent to the Start-Up client.


The greatest obstacle to viral-ability of your Start-Up's Android Application is the worldview of the
Start-up and the worldview of the Android Device user.  If you launch their lives they will be your best
spokesperson for your start-up. Launch their Lives by [contacting Fred Grott(GWS)](../readme_details/contact) to launch
your start-up's Android Application Development.
