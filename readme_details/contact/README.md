* My Google-Voice-Number is obviously for clients only however I do respond favorably to questions
  posed to my email address if you can answer the preliminary questions I always ask:

  * Is your budget higher than ? And do you have funding?

  * What Project Development Time Period expectations do you have?

  * Features of the Android Application desired are?

  * You state immediately, How Immediate and why the Immediacy in the form of what company goals does it
    reach in being executed immediately?

  or ven if you have changed your job title to something else.
