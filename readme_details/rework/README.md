Remote Code Development-ReWork
==============================

BaseCamp(formerly 37Signals) co-founder authored a book recently called ReWork. I have found that if
I use certain techniques and tools in combination with the advice from BaseCamp that I am very effective
in the amount of code I produce and the quality of that code.

# Techniques and Tools Used

* Google-Voice-Mail, rings into all my devices and transcribes all my messages to text and sends
  me email of every call.

* Slack-Channels, I set up Slack-channels for each project so that the project stakeholders can pose
  questions to me as they arise.
