ANDROID vs iOS

ANDROID and iOS are of course different mobile application platforms. ANDROID
has some distinct advantages if you are in need of a fast way to do a
POLISHED GUI MOBILE APPLICATION in fast amount of time. Some brief background
into this area.

The C computer language was designed for constructing Operating Systems because programmers were tired of using Assembly Language that had to be optimized per
CPU as C is CPU agnostic. With C++ the added more stuff to the C for OOP use.
ObjectiveC, which iOS uses, and Swift are still just layers on top of a
COMPUTER LANGUAGE that is still oriented toward the Operating System creation
way of doing things. Its still quite a bit in-flexible and not fast in code
creation as far as creating Applications.

In ANDROID's case it uses the Java Computer Language which was designed to make
it easy to build OOP applications without the in-flexible HEAVINESS of
Systems Operating Programming C-way of doing things. This is one-half of the
core reasons why I can take a 4-month estimate of completing an iOS application
and state that the Android edition of the same mobile application will only
take 2 to 3 months to develop.
