FAST AGILE ANDROID APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
==========================================


The other HALF of DOING IT FASTER THAN iOS has to do with understanding that
GUI mobile application have a lot of boilerplate code to them and that one can
build up a GUI and Mobile Application set of libraries to reduce, SIGNIFICANTLY,
the amount of boilerplate code that has to be created. This goes to the heart
of the GROTTWOKRSHOP difference in that I can create the Android Application
faster than any iOS developer you can get to create the iOS application and
that Android Application is structured in a way to assist the
Android Mobile Device User to LAUNCH THEIR LIFE.

# The Agile Development Tools in my Software Engineering Tool-box

* Test Driven Development, unit test driven development which is typically use when we know there is
  a large amount of business logic and business objects when compared to the amount of GUI code.

* Kabaan or Scrum, typically longer development times match better with using Kabaan

* Behavior-test Driven Development, typically useful for those application projects with
  complex user-interfaces

* Aspect Code Weaving, used to reduce boilerplate code

* Annotation Processors, used also to reduce boilerplate code

* Break-Into-Smallest-Unit-Possible, used tyo reduce the number software engineering chain-of-assumptions
  which results in a more predictable unit of software engineering application development

* Customization of Views and Widgets and User-interface Research, the Android Java Application
  just like its iOS counterpart has a moving or dynamic moving target as far as what the
  Android Device User gets trained to expect in a User-Interface with the popular applications they use.
  Thus, I research how to software development new User-Interface Views and Widgets continuously.

* Kotlin, when appropriate I use a a Java Language shorthand called Kotlin to speed up development of
  Java code.

* Instrumented Testing, many developers make the assumption that heavy User-Interface applications such
  as mobile applications should not be instrumented tested(via emulator or device) or that those tests
  should be reduced. However, I have found from practical experience and software engineering research
  that is not effective and thus I adhere to the instrumented testing best practices as implemented by
  Google in development of their popular Android Applications.

* Continuous Integration Building and Testing, this follows the break inot smallest unit principles
  in that I build and test daily.

* Inversion-Of-Dependencies, when possible I use the inversion-of-dependencies principle by using an
  injection library. For view injections I use Butterknife and for full dependency injection I use Dagger2.

* Clean-UI-Application-Architecture, its an Object-Oriented-Programming style of using the OOP-Patterns of
  fitting different code components together that separates concerns and scopes of the application in
  a way that produces a more resilient-stable and reliable application.
